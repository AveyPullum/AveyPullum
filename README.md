## About Me
     < My name is Avéy Pullum, and I am student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I enjoy things such as watching animé, running track, and relaxing with friends. As a part of my comp sci track, I have taken comp 110, 210 and 283. In these classes, I have learned how to code in python, obtained some experience in java, and also learned some computer science logic. These classes were very informative in learning about computer structures and also the technical coding side of things. I am interesting in learning more things about creating apps so that I can create things to help others and/or use my creativity in a digital manner. > 

## Skills
     < I had no coding experience before coming to UNC, so I am still in the process of learning and refining my skills >

     [] Python experience
     [] Java experience

### Classes
  #### Comp 110
     [] In this class, I learned how to code in python in this class and about simple data structures

  #### Comp 210
     [] In this class, I learned how to code in java in this class and more complex data structures
     
  #### Comp 283
     [] In this class, I learned a lot about computer science logic and doing proofs
     
  #### Comp 290
     [] In this class, I am learning about basics of computer science such using things like using my macbook's terminal, Docker, Github, and more. I am also learning ways to make my coding jobs more efficient in terms of collaborations with tools like making commits using github.

  #### Comp 455
     [] In this class, I am learning about how to make regular expressions, transition diagrams, NFAs, DFAs, and more.

### Tools and Programming Languages
< I know how to code in python, and I have some experience coding in Java as well. In both langueages, I have done class assignments and used github and docker to help store and save my work. Using python, I have created drawings, codes to interact with users, and codes to keep track of my work. I have also used Java to make user interactions and to keep track of work as well.
