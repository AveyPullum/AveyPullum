## About Me
My name is Avéy Pullum, and I am 2nd year student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I enjoy things such as watching animé, running track, and relaxing with friends. As a part of my comp sci track, I have taken comp 110, 210 and 283. In these classes, I have learned how to code in python, obtained some experience in java, and also learned some computer science logic. These classes were very informative in learning about computer structures and also the technical coding side of things. I am interesting in learning more things about creating apps so that I can create things to help others and/or use my creativity in a digital manner.

## Skills
I started my computer science journey as a freshman at UNC, so I am still in the process of learning and refining my skills

    [] Python Coding
    [] Java Coding

### Classes

  #### Comp 110
    [] I gained experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, 
           and ethics in computing

  #### Comp 210
    [] In this class, I learned how to organize the data used in computer programs so that manipulation 
           of that data can be done efficiently on large problems and large data instances
     
  #### Comp 283
    [] In this class, I learned discrete structures (sets, tuples, relations, functions, graphs, trees) and the 
           formal mathematics (logic, proof, induction) used to establish their properties and those of algorithms that work with them. 
   
    [] I also further developed problem-solving skills through puzzles and applications central to computer science.
     
  #### Comp 290
    [] In this class, I am learning about basics of computer science such using things like using my macbook's 
           terminal, Docker, Github, and more. I am also learning ways to make my coding jobs more efficient in terms 
           of collaborations with tools like making commits using github.

  #### Comp 455
    [] I am currently in this class, however, I am learning about the theory of computation. Things such as finite automata, 
           regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, and turing machines are being taught.

### Tools and Programming Languages
I know how to code in python, and I have some experience coding in Java as well. In both langueages, I have done class assignments and used github and docker to help store and save my work. Using python, I have created drawings, codes to interact with users, and codes to keep track of my work. I have also used Java to make user interactions and to keep track of work as well.
